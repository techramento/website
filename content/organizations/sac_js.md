We are excited to build a great community focused on all things Javascript. That means learning about new standards like ES6, frameworks like Polymer and React, tooling like Browserify and GulpJS, robotics like NodeBots and Johnny-Five, libraries like D3 and Lodash, conferences like JSConf and JSFest, and everything else that is out there or yet to be created!
